This dashboard visually analyzes Airbnb listings in NYC, using 9 different charts. It covers revenue distribution, booking behavior, pricing trends, room types, 
and outlier patterns—offering insights for hosts and business strategists to optimize listings and revenue.

Insights by Business Questions:

1. Which neighbourhood group brings in the highest revenue?
Manhattan clearly generates the most revenue, followed by Brooklyn and Queens. This indicates high demand and premium pricing in central locations.


2. Which room types bring more revenue and how are they reviewed?
Entire homes/apartments yield higher average revenue, while private rooms get more reviews per month. This shows a trade-off between occupancy and income.


3. Does minimum nights affect guest engagement (reviews)?
Listings with 1–3 minimum nights get more reviews/month, meaning lower minimum stays may attract more frequent bookings.


4. Where are the top-performing listings located geographically?
High-revenue listings cluster around central NYC (likely Manhattan), suggesting that location strongly impacts profitability.


5. Which hosts own the most listings (potential high earners)?
Certain hosts have many listings (top 10 shown), possibly operating as professional property managers or businesses.


6. How does seasonality impact bookings?
Bookings spike in spring and early summer (April–June), then decline—important for pricing and availability planning.


7. Are lower-priced listings reviewed more?
Yes—there’s a clear inverse relationship between price and reviews/month, suggesting guests are more price-sensitive.


8. Are there underutilized listings (high availability, low engagement)?
Yes—listings with high availability but low reviews/month suggest poor visibility, appeal, or pricing strategy.


9. Which features most influence price?
The heatmap shows correlations—minimum nights and number of reviews have moderate impact, while availability has lesser correlation with price.
